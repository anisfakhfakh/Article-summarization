# Text-summarization
This project is an attempt to try the different text summarization techniques.
My other projects will be porgressively uploaded at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh).

#### -- Project Status: [Complete]

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a text summarizer using both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques to summariez the CNN stories (articles).

* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow
* stats

## Project Description
The project uses the data: CNN news articles and their summarires in order to synthetise a summary for each article
## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Follow instructions on the Data preprocessing & Data analysis notebook to download the data
3. Data preprocessing
4. Data Data analysis
5. Extractive summary pipeline
6. Same data is used for abstractive approach
